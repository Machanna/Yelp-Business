# Yelp Clone
Using [Yelp's API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search), built a native iOS app using Swift, SwiftUI for searching and displaying business establishments within a set distance from the user's current location.

## Build and Runtime Requirements
- Xcode 11.0 or later
- iOS 13.0 or later
- OS X v10.15 or later
- iCloudâ€“enabled provisioning profile

## Description
1. The first screen displays the results based on user's location. If location isn't enabled it displays results by using zero coordinates.
   It has a navigation search bar to search for businesses by a term(e.g. food, restaurants or by business name ).
2. The second screen has a map with the users's current location and a dropped pin on the business location and some details regarding the business. (e.g. Name, review ratings, address, distance etc.)
   If location isn't enabled it displays business details and a simple map without any dropped pin.
